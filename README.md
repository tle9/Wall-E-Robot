# CS 3651 - Prototyping Intelligent Devices (Spring 2024)
## Class Overview:
CS 3651 Prototyping Intelligent Devices is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience for electronic device prototyping and development. The course material focuses on elementary electronic skills building, microcontroller firmware development, simple physical prototyping, and inventive problem solving. The course is lab-based with an open-ended final project.

## Project Scope:
The projects should include mechanical, electrical, and software components. It should also include some kind of digital logic, likely a microcontroller, with input, some kind of processing, and output.

## Project Description:
The project aims to construct a functional small-scale robot inspired by Wall-E, with a focus on mobility through the integration of distance sensors. The team envisions utilizing 3D printing technology to manufacture the robotâ€™s chassis. Our goal is to meticulously recreate a miniaturized version of Wall-E. This project involves a combination of mechanical design, sensor integration, and programming to bring the mini Wall-E to life.
